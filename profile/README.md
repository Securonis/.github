# Securonis Linux

Securonis Linux is a privacy- and security-focused Linux distribution based on Debian (testing). It includes a preconfigured tool that forces all incoming and outgoing connections through the Tor network. The system comes preloaded with various privacy and security tools, along with some custom-developed utilities.  
Securonis Linux uses the MATE desktop environment. It can be run in live mode or installed permanently using the Calamares installer. The goal of Securonis is to provide a secure system suitable for everyday use.
